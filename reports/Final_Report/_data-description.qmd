- **Data Format**
  - The input to our pipeline consists of:
    - Images in standard formats (e.g., `.jpg`)
    - Corresponding YOLO-formatted `.txt` label files
      - Each line in a label file includes: class ID, normalized bounding box coordinates (x_center, y_center, width, height)
      - Example: `1 0.757593 0.34663 0.06101 0.3655`

- **Object Categories**
  - The detection task focuses on five classes:
    1. Fire
    2. Smoke
    3. Lightning
    4. Vehicle
    5. Person

- **Data Volume**
  - Partner expects approximately 500 new images per month

- **Role in Pipeline**
  - This incoming data serves as the foundation for the pipelineâ€™s three core stages:
    1. Labeling via dual-model process and human in the loop
    2. Data augmentation for increase diversity
    3. Base model re-training
