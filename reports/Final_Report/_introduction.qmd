- **Motivation**
  - Wildfires are a growing environmental threat with devastating consequences.
  - According to Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC), early detection is critical to minimizing damage and preventing spread.

- **Partner Context**
  - Our capstone partner, Bayes Studio, uses specialized cameras for environmental monitoring and wildfire detection.
  - These cameras act as edge devices â€” carrying a lightweight model for wildfire detection

- **Problem Statement**
  - The partner currently faces a manual and time-consuming workflow:
    - Labeling incoming environmental imagery
    - Fine-tuning a base detection model
    - Compressing models for edge deployment
  - This bottleneck limits their ability to rapidly adapt models to changing data.

- **Technical Requirements**
  - For effective deployment on edge devices, the model must:
    1. Be trained on high-quality labeled data
    2. Be fine-tuned to current wildfire imagery
    3. Undergo distillation and quantization to compress the model to meet hardware constraints

- **Our Solution**
  - We developed an automated, continuous, and dynamic machine learning pipeline that:
    - Performs semi-automated labeling to create high-quality data (images)
    - Fine-tunes a YOLOv8 object detection model on newly labeled data
    - Applies model compression techniques (distillation and quantization)
    - Outputs edge-deployable models for real-time wildfire detection
