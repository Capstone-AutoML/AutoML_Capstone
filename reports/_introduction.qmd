Wildfires are tragic environmental disasters that pose a threat to ecosystems and communities.
Our Capstone partner, Bayes Studio, a Vancouver-based startup utilize advanced AI tools for environmental monitoring and early detection of wildfires using computer vision.
The problem our partner is faced with is keeping detection models up to date as new data becomes available. 
The current workflow involves manual labeling of incoming images using existing `YOLO` object labeling model, followed by retraining and redeployment. 
As new data becomes available frequently, this manual and repetitive approach results in delays, bottlenecks in model improvement, and ultimately slower response times in wildfire detection.
This has real-world consequences as early detection of fire ignitions is crucial in mitigation efforts to limit damages of wildfires to nearby communities [@drdc2022].


Our objective is to automate and streamline this update process through a reproducible data science pipeline. 
When new images arrive, the pipeline will initiate automated pre-labelling using the partner's `YOLO` model. 
To ensure reliability, a secondary model - Meta's Segment Anything Model (`SAM`) - will be utilized to verify YOLO's predictions.
If the labels from both models agree, the image is accepted. Otherwise, it is routed to a human-in-the-loop labelling interface built with open-source tools such as `Label Studio`. We will also ensure that the model is edge-deployable by introducing distillation and quantization steps when model has undergone retraining.

The final product delivered to our partner will be an end-to-end automated pipeline, deployed via Github Actions, which takes new images and outputs and updated YOLO model file (`.pt`). This approach reduces human efforts, shortens turnaround time for model updates, and increases labelling accuracy.
