Bayes Studio, a Vancouver-based startup focused on wildfire detection, 
faces challenges updating their computer vision models as new image data becomes available.
Their current manual labeling workflow delays model improvement and deployment. Our Capstone product is an automated,
reproducible pipeline that begins with pre-labeling using `YOLOv8`, verified with Meta's Segment Anything Model (`SAM`).
Ambiguous cases are routed to a human-in-the-loop system via Label Studio. The verified data is then used to retrain and update the model. The model undergoes distillation and quantization for edge-device utilization. The final deliverable is a fully automated CI/CD pipeline that continuously updates an edge-deployable YOLO model.
